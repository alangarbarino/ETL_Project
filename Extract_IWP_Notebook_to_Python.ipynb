    "# EXTRACT: SCRAPING iwaspoisoned.com\n",
    "#* This Python code performs scraping of the iwaspoisoned.com website, capturing incident information on each page and across multiple pages\n",
    "#* The information scraped in inserted into a MongoDB database `etl_db` in the collection `iwp` using the dictionary/document format provided below.\n",
    "#* The code is structure as a set of functions:\n",
    "#    * scrape_iwp(a_startpage=1, a_pagecount=20000): The function to be called by external programs to perform scraping and provide results in MongoDB.  The arguments are optional and the defaults values are as indicated.\n",
    "#    \n",
    "#    * Supporting functions:\n",
    "#        * parse_incident_page(): This function is called for each iwaspoisoned.com website.  I uses the functions parse_one_incident() to capture the required information for each incident and returns an array of dictionaries.\n",
    "#        * parse_one_incident(): This function is called for each incident and captures needed per-incident data, including a call to get_incident_details() to scrape incident address information from the per-incident detail page.\n",
    "#        * get_incident_detail(): This function is called on a per-incident basis to navigate to the incident detail page to collect information not available from the main page, specifically: address.\n",
